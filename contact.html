			<p>Home Plate is a new program starting in January of 2016, spearheaded by the Cornell University Student Assembly's City and Local Affairs Committee to help bridge the Cornell and Ithaca communities through regular dinners between small groups of Cornell students and Ithaca residents.</p>

			<p>As with any new program, we know we will run into some problems along the way. We welcome any questions, comments, or concerns you might have. Please feel free to let us know how we can improve Home Plate moving forward.</p>

			<p>If you have any questions, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:homeplate@cornell.edu">homeplate@cornell.edu</a>.</p>

			<p>Thank you for considering joining the program for its pilot round spring semester of 2016.</p>

			<p class="italized">Home Plate is supported by the Office of Student and Campus Living and the Office of Off-Campus Living.</p>
